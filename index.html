Okay. Good morning or afternoon or evening. Everybody from wherever you're calling in today and welcome to our third lecture for this subject. Today we're going to be delving into the world of literacy, policy and thinking about that at both the local and global levels. So to begin with, I'd like to pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land on which I am living in working today. For me, that is the, we're undreamed of the colon nation. And to pay my respects to their elders, past, present and emerging and certain knowledge that sovereignty was never sated. And as always, I consider the ways that language and literacy have existed on this land for generations. And the many policies and the impact of those policies have had on indigenous peoples on this land. And I hold those things in my mind as we move through today's lecture. So today we're going to continue expanding our perspectives on literacy as both a local and a global process. And we're zooming out a little bit today. So we've been looking very personally at the relationship between literacy and our identities. And today we'll be zooming out to look a little bit more broadly at the kinda more macro level. To be looking at. The weather, policy shapes our particular practices within scoring. And to understand the role of teacher agency within literacy policies. So we're going to hear a little bit from Professor Joseph, Joseph Lo Bianco. He worked for a number of years within the language and literacy team here at MJC. Here's the former chair of language and literacy at MJC. And he's had a lot of experience, extensive experience globally. I'm consulting with various governments, particularly around policies in education and specifically those pertaining to language and literacy. So we'll be hearing from him drawing on his expertise as someone who's had a lot of first-hand experience engaging with policy development, which will be great. And so these icons that I have on the screen here, and I'm hoping that you can see them at my little video hasn't cut them off. This image here we'll plan to portray how we'll organize our thinking about literacy, policy, about policy and education. As we moved through today's session, we're going to be thinking a lot about the continuum between governments and the ways that policies are formed by governments, and the ways that, that feeds through to practice in scores and particularly in the practice that individual teachers. So we'll be thinking a lot about that continuum of actions between policy is being formed at a governmental level and the actions that education practitioners take in teaching contexts. Now, policy is really interesting to examine because it tells us a lot about how literacy is seen within society in a lot of your readings this week, we'll continue to address that. So it shows us a lot about how literacy is perceived. A measure of government's effectiveness in relation to education. And also a number of different kinds of metaphors that rise in the way that we think about literacy. So it's going to help us in continuing to broaden our sense of what literacy is. And we'll explore that further through the free body reading this week and also a little bit later in the lecture today. Okay, so I wanna just start by giving a little bit of context around the ways that policy shapes lives. These are some personal examples from my family's history of the ways that policy has kind of shapes migration and shaped life experiences. So the first example I've got there on the left-hand side is just a brief snippet of a newspaper article about the similar only bill. Now this was brought in, in Sri Lanka in 1956. So independence had been achieved and appropriate earlier. But in 1956, it was decided that in order to give back a sense of Sri Lankan identity, whereas previously, English had been kinda the language of governments, the language of policymaking. And it built was brought in to your man that's similar, would now be considered the national language. Now this had a number of repercussions. So for my family of burger heritage, even though they had learned to speak similar, but they had not felt that it was important to learn to read and write similar. And so having Sinaloa come in as the official language had implications for their ability to participate in Sri Lankan society fully. And I'd mentioned this lightly because it was not just the burger population was impacted by the spill, it was also the tunnel population. And so the introduction of this similar only bill was quite marginalizing for the tumble population. And this was kind of a bit of a catalyst for the Civil War that then break out in Sri Lanka. But I mentioned this just to point out the ways that these kinds of ways that language is governed, literacy practices are governed through policy, have the capacity to cause huge changes within a society now at the same time. So this article on the right-hand side is referring to the Australian context. At the same time in Australia where you were governed by an Immigration Act. I was part of the white Australian policy and meant that any migrants who entered Australia at this particular point in time could be asked to take a dictation test. And this dictation test formed part of the decision-making process as to who was allowed to migrate and who was not. And so any migrants. So my grandparents were in this position, would be given a test. So a verbal tests, a dictation test where they would need to write out 50 words in a number of European languages. So my grandparents, who did not speak Italian, did not arrive. Italian, for example, could be sat down and given a test in Italian. And this test. And their ability to perform in that test would decide whether they were permitted to migrate to Australia. So just two examples of policies that were in place at a particular point in time that, that kind of had the capacity to really shaped not only where people migrated to where people were able to live, but then obviously they're also identity implications for those things as well. So when we talk about policy today, we will be talking about policy as a very living thing. We're not just talking about pieces of paper. We are talking about forms of documentation that have huge capacity to shape our lives and our practices. Now because I would like you to have fresh in your minds what exactly we're referring to when we think about policy. I've got just a few examples here that could give you something to hold in the back of your mind in terms of what we're talking about when we talk about policy. So I'm drawing on some examples from previous cohorts that have been in a subject for your contexts. This might mean thinking about the national college entrance examination in China. The requirements for English-speaking and English participation that might be needed to pass those examinations. You might think about the role of English as a compulsory subjects in high schools in China. And there are different policies that decide what age English needs to be, what yield levels of schooling needs to be. Have English as a compulsory subject. There are others of your colleagues who have mentioned the presence of mandarin only policies in some schools and districts where regardless of other dialects that might be present in the matter in the language of instruction. That has a parallel to this first four hours policy in Australia, which we'll examine as a case study later, enrich, indigenous bilingual communities. Had a policy put in place that meant that the first four hours of every day needed to be taught in English. In the Australian context. Another example of current policy that's receiving quite a bit of attention and debate is the presence of a phonics screening check of year 1 students in South Australia. And this is seen as a way of ensuring that all students attain reading and writing literacy early in their education. And then you might look at examples such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander educational plans that were referred to previously. The closed the gap initiatives and a different kind of statistical measures that correspond with those. There are a range of different policies that we could draw it. And I will invite you towards the ends to identify a policy that you will bring to your seminar to continue this discussion around a particular policy is relevant to your context and what the implications of those policies. So we have an image here, but I'd like you to just take a moment to reflect on. And this is a metaphor that Professor Joe lo Bianco has drawn on in speaking about how we think about policy. So here we have an immovable object, but someone is attempting to. And so change making, particularly in education. Can be seen a little bit like this. We haven't immovable objects, we have huge systems, strong systems in place. And whenever we try and introduce some kind of change within their systems, it's a little bit like trying to get an immovable object to move. This object can be moved if an appropriate policy is put in place. If we can implement policy and really effective ways we can affect change within education systems. So getting systems that are very big and unwieldy and strong to move according to our wishes is quite an undertaking. And that's kinda what we'll examine a little bit further when we stick with Joe. But when it is done well, when policy is implemented in effective ways, even though we are smaller than the huge system we are trying to move, we can influence some kind of change in some kind of difference regardless of the size, the magnitude of, of the different systems that we are trying to change. So in thinking about that, we can think about questions of motivations. So this is a bit of a metaphor that's often used as a bit of a way to bring about change. So it's the idea of we can either entice people to change through giving them an incentive or a reward. So that's what that current represents. Or we can try and arrange changed through punishments, through kinds of penalties and consequences. So it's a useful metaphor. What does the government do to bring about change within our education systems? How to teach us implement that and how are they motivated in different ways? And then how a student's impacted upon with these different policy changes that have brought around how a student is motivated and how do we get students to achieve in particular ways? So what we're asking ourselves here is how do we get people within the system to move themselves? And this is kind of one of the larger questions that we ask when we engage with policy. So to begin with, we'd like to think for a minute about the role of policy in education, particularly how it shapes our practices as people who might work within education or be aspiring to work within education. And to think about this with mine, to draw on the work of a theorist called Dorothy Smith. So Dorothy Smith wrote a really pivotal texts in the 1980s called institutional Ethnography. And what she was examining words, how society works, how different institutions and organizations shape society. And how those institutions and organizations shape individual's lives through texts. So Dorothy's work explores how text's shape practice and this is where policy is really interesting. There's a documents, these are texts, but they have the power to shape how we engage in our practices. So she argues that texts have been unique role to play in shaping about every day and professional lives and practice. And she kind of raises the question. So in this context, we're going to be applying her question to our work as teachers on methods of education institutions. What are the texts that shape our lives? So the kind of question that directly raises for us is, as members of schooling institutions, how do societies had an organization's values? Come through via text to inform the way that we work and what policy holds us accountable for. So what government policy is, ask us to do in our practice, those kinds of forms of accountability come through to shape what it is that we do and how we set priorities in, for example, our classrooms or our schooling environments. Now in moving towards thinking about the kinds of the role of ourselves and our personal identities within larger organizations. This is what Dorothy Smith has to say. She says that we are ruled by forms of organization that invested in and mediated by texts. I'm documents. And this is constituted externally to the particular individuals like us that are working within education systems and our personal and familial relationships. It involves the construction of the world as texts, whether on paper or in a computer. And the creation of a world intact as the site of action. So it literally actions that take place within education systems. Those actions take place within particular documents and texts. And there are forms of consciousness that are created, that are properties of organizations or particular ways of doing discourse rather than of individual subjects. So this is kind of where we can interrogate that relationship between ourselves and our own identities and our own values and priorities in our practice and the values and priorities of organizations. So she draws our attention to this distinction between, you know, a lot about operation in our day-to-day life is around personal relationships, are relationships with family members, for example. But there's this other form of relating that Dorothy Smith draws our attention to, which is a relationship to a particular way of thinking that organizations kind of shape through a particular texts and documents. So thinking about that, it's kind of moment here for us to think about where we're situated within this document. So Dorothy argues that institutional priorities, so the priorities of schools, organizations, governments, they become our lived experiences. And it's through texts that these things become part of our lived experience. Now she argues, there's an opportunity here to see our agency as members of these institutions. So she says that knowing how things work and how they're put together is invaluable for those who often have to struggle in the dark. For example, knowing the implications for our practice can be very useful at the point where changes have not yet been settled and where there is room for maneuver. And we're going to return to this idea of room for maneuver towards the end of this lecture. But what she's really highlighting here is that if we understand how policy works, we understand how these documents come to shape the practice of those of us that work within these institutions. Then we can start to see where this wriggle room, where there's opportunities for us to maneuver, to make change ourselves and to exercise our agency. So let's take a moment to pause and sketch out the relationship between yourself and education policy. So you might want to think about some of the examples that I shared at the beginning of this lecture. And these little sketches that you're going to bring along to your seminar to share with a small group this week. So take a moment here to just sketch out how do you visualize the relationship between policy and yourself. Now, for those of you who are currently working in a school environment, you might wish to illustrate this in terms of your relationship as a teacher with policy. For those of you who have not yet worked in school settings yet, you might wish to illustrate this, your relationships with policy as a student. So thinking about some of the policies that shape your educational experiences. You might wish to include how students sit with them, it's relationship students and teachers. You might wish to also show how that governments, members of the broader community and other key stakeholders interact with this relationship. So what we wanna do here is just capture what is it that you think of when you think about how you relate to policy? Doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be an absolute artwork. Just sketch something that gives an indication of that relationship that we can then interrogate and kind of explore further in our seminars this week. Okay, so to expand on the activity that you just completed, here is one visualization of the relationship between teachers and policy. Now this is an example that won't necessarily be irrelevant to your contexts. This was made as a, as an artifact that we explored within some professional development that MDSC stuff ran in another state. But this is a bit of a visualization of what that relationship can look like between policy and individuals operating within education institutions. So here we have at the very broadest ends, I guess the role of the OECD that pays are testing that happens with 15-year-old students every three years. So those international test results definitely play a role in how nations motivate themselves, right? Policy, think about education. Then we have that gray bubble which looks at national vision and priorities. So here we have things like score for measures that federal governments have in place. We have the Closing the Gap initiatives that we have discussed a little bit that talk about closing statistical gaps between indigenous and non-indigenous life experiences. We have the Australian curriculum. From that Australian curriculum, we have literacy learning progressions and EAL D learning progressions, more documents at a national level that shape our practice as teachers. There's a range of other kinds of national initiatives. They're around optimizing stem education and industry and school partnerships. There's a range of different things that happen on a national level by which policy shapes how we think about education and how we implement vegetation. And then that next circle shows the state's vision and priorities. So within a state, the state might take documents from the federal level around school reform and improvement. And then the statement then describe what school improvement looks like within that location. That might look like a state initiative to lift outcomes around that plan. At the state level, there are policies and approaches and initiatives that are started in order to kind of improve education outcomes. And then that first pink bubble there shows a school's vision and priorities. So that's school receives those mandates from the state level and then implements them in a site-specific way. So that might look like school improvement plans is what they're called in this particular location. It might look like particular initiatives around literacy across the curriculum. There might be particular guidebooks and shared texts the school might use. There might be particular shared pedagogies and literacy approaches that are implemented that are specific to that school. And then in the innermost circle we haven't individual teacher with their own vision and priorities and practice. And so this is one way that we can visualize this kind of handing down of priorities. However, Joe encourage us to really encourages us to really think about the two way nature of this relationship. But teachers also have agency with them, their own practice to innovate, to engage in decision-making. There are a number of different ways that teachers can also feed back through policy as well. So we're going to explore a little bit more of that notion of that relationship. So it's going to take us through a little bit around the process of policy-making for this first section, yeah. And the ways that we can think about how policy comes about on a broader level. Policymakers who are trained in policy schools and schools of government and universities and technical institutes talk about the work that they do as policy analysis. And what they mean by this is that they public administrators, but this also includes principals in schools and people in education departments in state governments or other education jurisdictions, that these people look at different policy positions, what's available. They call them the options. And they produce what's called an options paper or an options comparison. So that compare which course of action. So you've got a problem of literacy standards or literacy underachievement, or new technologies coming in. And people need new literacies to deal with these new technologies. You come up with some options too. Deal with this problem. And then what they do is look at each of these options according to the cost and benefit of taking this course of action or that cause of action. And then you come up with a new policy which is a prescription, a form of intervention to change it. That's the classic way in which policy analysis. One of the most influential of these policy analysis approaches is John Kingdon's multiple streams framework. And I'm going to describe that in the next few slides. And basically what he says is that When we look at how policy actually operates, we see that there are multiple streams of action, a continuum of actions all going on at the same time. But we can group them together into different streams. And I'll describe these now. The three streams in Kingdon's 1994 analysis. We're problem, policy and political. In other words, there's work going on in defining problems. Arguing about which problems should be given focused in an attention and money from government, or in schools or in some of the institution, which one should we focus on? There's always debate about that. There's always debate about policy, about the right kind of intervention to do. And then there's politics that goes on around it, such as competition between people, resources, political ideologies. All of those things are always happening at the same time. And often they stop any kind of action from going ahead because people can't agree. But occasionally, you get all these variables coming together and they produce what Kingdon calls a window of opportunity. And in this window of opportunity, which only happens every so often, you get a new course of action, a new form of progress that makes some kind of new action possible in a particular area. Sometimes this is forced on people, and other times it comes about through a high level of agreement. But there's a window of opportunity that breaks the deadlock of the problem stream, the policy stream and the political stream in Kingdon's system not coming together. And suddenly a new opportunity. Very briefly, I'm going to talk of each of kingdoms, kingdoms 1980 for strings. So the problem stream, the political stream and the policy stream. Now, in the problem stream, what we're basically talking about is argument using my own, his idea, argument and discussion about which issues should be given attention. Because we know it's not possible to do everything at once. People have to prioritize that must come up with some choices. Government doesn't have unlimited money. Teachers don't have unlimited time. Schools have to make choices. So some times, some kind of argument about what is the main problem that will be focused on needs to be resolved so that decision can reach the sea. And often this happens because there's a crisis, a dramatic event that lifts one of the problems that's being contested above all the others and it's given spatial attention at that time. Now sometimes this elevation of one problem, of other problems in the problem stream happens because of an external event. It could be an economic crisis. Could be the pandemic that we're going through right at the moment. It could be some kind of technological innovation. A new research study, something that interrupts or the argument about what is the problem we're going to focus on and makes one of them stand out above all the others. So that's how the problem stream is usually resolved through argument, often with an external influence. And teachers have got a major role to play in this. And this is where teachers become part of the debate of language and literacy policy. Because their voice in discussions about what problems need to be given focus can be seen as part of the policy process, one of the continuums of action. While the problems stream is going on in the background, policymakers are always weighing up alternatives and hear the impact of teachers is less obvious and less direct. But it can still be present. Usually, this involves the policy stream, involves that discussions undertaken by experts and analysts and gauged by government or academics or media, or the lobbyists or think tanks. Teachers can interact with these people and bring the problems that they think should be brought to attention of government in their, in their level of focus. But mostly this is a discussion that goes on Among these particular groups in administration. And they usually work through things called green papers, investigations, evaluations, policy reports, government studies, et cetera. This is the kind of modality in which the policy stream functions. The modality of the problem stream is usually public discussion and argument through the media. But here we have the, mostly the predict, the producing of studies and reports and examinations. Finally, we have the political stream, which of course we all know about and understand because this is the politics of life that we're all part of. And within the political stream, What's going on is the regular course of discussion and debate in which one issue is pitted against another issue, not to different parts of the same issue. Now, in the problem stream, you might have people involved with phonics and people who support global literacy or who want a multimodal literacy approach, or who think ESL children should be given priority out over other needs in literacy education or who want a whole language approach that's within the problems stream, within the literacy camp. Whereas here, when literacy enters the political stream, it has to contest with everything, defense and taxes and environmental protection and health policy. And it has to be elevated above those or alongside them to be given attention. And he teaches can have an influence through how they advocate. In relation to other interest groups to rise above all keep be given some focus within government authorities. Now, obviously mostly this works through ministers of education, but in the end, ministers of education still have to go to a cabinet meeting in which they sitting beside a Minister for Health and the Minister for welfare and administer for roads and admin list of all the other things that government has to deal with. And the priority for policy literacy has to be ranked against all the other things that government is focusing on at that time. So you can see that we go from the problem stream where we are within the education and literacy community. And we're debating and discussing how the issue of literacy is to be focused on what methods one particular understandings of the problem of literacy will be given the most attention. Then we go into the policy stream where the experts of policymaking churning through the different options and they're debating which ones to give attention to. And then ultimately, things have to get up to the political stream where what we're claiming for literacy has to take its place alongside all the other demands on government at that particular time. So for the policy stream, the problem stream, and the political stream to come together, something special has to happen, as I said before, it can be an external influence. It could be some really persuasive argument coming up from the ground, up from the teacher community or from representatives of parents or the media or somewhere. And it has to break the deadlock of argument and disagreement. And for that to happen is what Kingdon calls a policy window to open. And usually it's the political stream that does that because they have to say, Okay, we're going to give attention to phonics. And we know that this has happened in recent years. And the people who have been promoting a phonics solution to literacy education have had the success of gaining the attention of governments. So they've succeeded within the problem stream of ranking the solution to the problem and the issue of literacy above other alternatives that's then provide within the policy stream. Because policymakers have given some attention to it, looked at and thought about how would work. Then they've gotten the attention of politicians who then provide the funding for it. And they did this through continually producing studies that they believe show that students need more phonics. And the teachers have neglected this. You might not agree with this, but this is the process of Kingdon's way of understanding policy. That particular voice has opened a policy window and we can see that it's gone through the three channels of the problem stream, the policy stream, and the political stream. And it's now pretty strong in policy-making today. On this slide. You can see some of what I mean by continuum of actions. Continuum basically means a sequence of actions in which there's no really sharp division between two points that are close to each other. But at the extreme in there is a big difference. So if you're one end of the continuum, you might not think that the other end of the continuum relates to you. But actually through a series of very small dividing points, the two ends are actually linked. So you can imagine at one end a government minister saying camera making decisions to allocate money to literacy policy. And at the other end, a teacher delivering a class in a primary school in Melbourne. These two are connected by a chain of actions that are gradually linked to each other. But at the extreme ends don't really look like they're linked to each other. So here we could ask the questions, what, who does policy, where is policy done? Why does policy exist? The relationship between government and policy? Is policy a set of rules that you have to follow or general directions that someone offers you that you can choose to follow, or some procedures that they tell you about how to follow something. And what about schools and teachers and policy? And what would a policy specifically for literacy looked like? Taking account of all of these points. Okay, so just again, returning to the idea of how you relate to policy, what, of what Joe has just shared with us, changes the way that you might think about that. For example, Joe, raise the idea of teachers advocating. So getting together collectively to advocate for policy to address particular aspects of how we teach in a classroom. It might mean that you are in a particular position within an educational institution. And you can find ways to innovate that might then change the way that practice happens more broadly across a school site, for example, it might mean that when government does conduct consultations with a school community that you participate in that way, you have your voices or teacher heard. What joy that Joe has really highlighted for us here is that there are a number of avenues by which teachers can interact with policy through these kinds of discrete levels of actions through which, you know what's decided at a policy level, at a government level, there are a range of different actions that are taken that kind of connect the relationship from being one member of an institution, perhaps the classroom teacher, perhaps in a different capacity in an education institution. And your connection through to the kinds of education ministers, the kind of governmental level at which policies are divided. So Joe's encouraging us to see that as a continuum. And there are a range of actions that link us on the ground in education settings through to those who are making those decisions at a policy level. We're going to continue to kind of interrogate that relationship, to continue talking about that in our seminars this week. So here we want to shift our attention slightly to thinking about the narratives of literacy policy. So ever turning our attention to how we think about literacy. And we're going to unpack a little bit more about how policies around literacy give us an idea of the way that literacy is seen within society and that's what that free body reading from this week. We'll continue to unpack Wiki. So free body proposes that when we think about literacy at a policy level, there are four main metaphors that emerged for how literacy is spoken about. So sometimes in policy, illiteracy is spoken about as a textual puzzle. Only. Now here I'd like you to make the connection back to what we did in the last seminar when we thought about literacy in three different levels on the Padlet. So we've thought about literacy skills level. We thought about literacy on a socio-cultural level, and we've thought about literacy on a critical level. Now this is kind of similar. There's four metaphors that free body brings to our attention. So you can see literacy as a textual causal. We can think about it on the skills level in terms of understanding how texts work. And that might be how policy speaks about literacy. Some policies will speak about literacy as a cognitive puzzle. So literacy is something that happens inside the minds of individuals in that particular metaphor. Some policies might speak about literacy as a cultural puzzle. So that kind of sociocultural lens bug language and literacy being something that is socially constructed, that we construct together as a particular culture in a society. And it can also be thought of. So we can also think about literacy as a puzzle of schooling, power, border and reform. And so when we think about it in that way, we're thinking about the role of schooling in how governments kind of institutionalized their power. Governments play a role in kind of promoting order and reforming society. And how schooling plays a very distinct role within that. So literacy can kinda be seen as a tool with them, that picture as well as part of the puzzle of how power plays out through schooling. So kind of similar to that kind of critical lens that we spoke about in class seminar. So we'll continue on here just talking about some of those other metaphors and narratives about literacy that come through and we think about policy. So again, from free body, he says that each of these different metaphors presents a distinctive take on a number of issues. So it's a particular viewpoint around conflicts, around how we should teach, how we should research what counts as evidence and solid data. It's different. Each of those different metaphors has a different perspective on how, where and to whom educational systems and individual teachers are held accountable. So how are we held accountable? Where are we held accountable? Who are we held accountable to? And all of those, those different issues are kinda assessed against. The evidence that is shown to those particular, takes, those particular perspectives on literacy. Now here we have another metaphor, this metaphor of looking back on the past through rose-colored glasses. So literacy, education is often discussed in the context of crisis. What are the discussions in Australia in recent years have been around this perceived crisis of literacy skills to climbing within the population. This means that we're comparing to an idea that previously we were doing a lot better. So this debate around literacy standards is kind of given this sense of urgency that we need to quickly kind of go back to the way that things used to be. That kind of superior past where our skills were perceived as higher. And this is where globalization placing with this relationship as well. That especially given these international tests that we'll talk about shortly, we want to be seen as competitive. And so we want to make sure that our literacy standards are high so that we can be globally competitive. Now, free-body also refers to literacy education as the scapegoat. And if you're not familiar with that particular metaphor in the Bible, escaped goat was, that was part of a ceremony by which all of the sense of a population would put on a literal who was then sent off into the wilderness to kinda take the stems away. Okay, So that's kind of where the metaphor comes from. And free body says that literacy, education has become a scapegoat of choice. So kind of the thing that gets blamed for all of the economics, social, moral, and intellectual failings of a society. So often when we feel like there's some kind of decline happening in society, literacy education tends to end up being within that we pinpoint that failing. So continuing on with free-body, here are some of the things that literacy has been credited for. Literacy has been credited with stimulating advances in technology and science in giving us capacity for logical thought, for developing our economies, and even for enabling our governments to perform in a democratic way. It is also been held responsible for the demise of languages. Even if we think back to that example of Greek media that we might have discussed in earlier weeks for perpetuating cultural imperialism after formal colonial rule. So that definitely that example of the similar only bill would be an example of how having a particular language be mandated as the particular language of the country is part of the way that colonial rule often happening. And stunting a wide array of human forms of thought and creative expression. So free body argues that the way that we see literacy, if we look at the wide variety of ways that humans can communicate and express themselves creatively. Literacy has also been credited or blamed with narrowing the array of ways that we see humans can communicate and express themselves. Now, Allan Luke is here with that critical perspective. So highlight that whatever pretenses we might have about the scientific formation of government policy. Policy is also selling the acceptance socially and culturally normative and regulative. So it plays a role in shaping us socially and culturally. It sets a set of norms for how we conduct ourselves, how we practice literacy, how we see education. And it plays a role in regulating us as a society as well. So Luke says policy is by definition, political, referring to Joe's work. So we've just heard from job at genre in 2002 that we need to really think about who gets a say in how policies are constructed? He asks, Isn't that some citizens will have policy done to them or done for them. While the rest of us, as literate citizens are free to shape our own futures. And this is where he raises this issue of binary, a bit of a split between how we see literacy for elites or from wealthier populations and how we see it for more marginalized and disadvantaged populations. So it might mean that we think that only basic literacy is suitable for more disadvantaged populations, but that wealthier elites within society would have access to a rich cultural literacy. So Joe's really calling into question the way that we perceive those ideas. Just some parts of the population have policy done to them, while the rest of us have more of a role in shaping our future. Now here we also pause to just consider indigenous perspectives on educational policy as well. And we spoke in week one a little bit about this idea of deficit discourse and how indigenous students are spoken about in policy. And we heard from Malaysia Hogarth, who's also spoken a lot about the need for genuine engagement and consultation required where indigenous voice is included within the policy development process. So Joe's just spoken about the policy development process, how policy comes about. And Malaysia, Hogarth is saying that we need more genuine engagement in consultation with indigenous communities in that process. Now, part of Meletus research has involved looking at documentation from many, many years ago, say 1975. Some of the documents that were produced around educational policy for indigenous students back then. And what researchers found is that this hasn't been a lot of change in the way that indigenous students are spoken about in policy and the kinds of concerns that aboriginal groups had back in the 1970s, a kind of still relevant today in the way that policy is written. So her argument barriers that if no change occurs, if policymakers continue to engage in the same way, then the risk is that in 40 years, the very same questions will continue to be asked about that gap between indigenous students and then non-indigenous counterparts. So unless we really radically changed the way that we consult with indigenous communities around the formation of policy. We will continue to get the same results. Okay, so here we're going to look at a particular case study of illiteracy related policy. That came through in 2008 and impacted upon a range of indigenous communities across Australia. So we're going to look at this policy, which was called the first four hours policy. But we're going to take a look at this through looking at global approaches to literacy, national approaches to literacy and local approaches to literacy. And kinda consider the ways that those three layers are functioning comes a bit on particular student's experiences. So I'm thinking globally, we think about the pisa assessments that happen every three years. So when we say peace, I went thinking of the program for International Student Assessment and which is run through the OECD, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. So this particular follow-up assessments, surveys 15-year-old students are high school students in a range of countries, but subscribe. And that's conducted on a three-year cycle. So this commenced in 3000. Now this is relevant for us in thinking about the case study policy which came through in 2008. So generally, Australia began performing quite well in literacy. It ranked second place in the first iteration of this literacy assessment. Since then, Australia's performance has declined. But at the same time, the test itself has also changed. Which raises a number of debates around whether that means Australian students are declining or whether it simply means that we are assessing literacy in a broader way that shows some gaps in Australia as way of thinking about literacy. But what I wanted to draw your attention to a, particularly for this case study, is that the disparity between achievement for indigenous and non-indigenous students has been highlighted in these peers or assessments. So this is from a press release from 2007. It says that the latest results from the OECD Pisa show a continuing wide gap in academic achievement between Australia's indigenous and non-indigenous students with very little improvement since Piazza was first conducted in 2 thousand. So this sets the scene for what was happening globally in conversations around Australian indigenous student achievement in that particular point in time. Now we referred in week 1 to the Closing the Gap framework, which is a good example of kind of a national framework for setting policies, setting targets and goals for indigenous student achievement. So closing the gap was established in 2008, and it sets targets for a number of different statistical areas where that gap was evidence. So we've just spoken about that gap of achievement between indigenous and non-indigenous students. In the pisa assessments. Closing the Gap, sought to close the gap around early childhood education, literacy, and numeracy at specified school levels, year 12 attainment and school attendance. So the aim was to have the gap by 2020. This was implemented at the same time as the case study policy that we're about to look at. These approaches were kind of quite new and current when this policy was brought into place. So now to look at this locally, the first four hours policy was implemented in 2008. Now you'll see a little bit more on the context and the way that this policy I'm folded in a video that we're about to watch. But what you need to know at this point was that in 2008 in the Northern Territory, this policy came through that was titled compulsory teaching in English for the first four hours at each school day. Now, many of the remote Indigenous communities across the top end of Australia had bilingual programs in place. So these had been established for 20 to 30 years at this point. Many years of resourcing and kind of labor had been put in by indigenous community members and linguists to develop bilingual programs by which indigenous students could learn in their first language as well as learn English. Now, when the first four hours policy was brought in, this had a really significant impact on the health of these programs. If you can't teach in an indigenous language for the first grabs, the day, you can only teach in English. Then that really kind of dismantles those bilingual programs that had been in place for some time. So this is the case study that we're going to look at. Now we're going to watch a video that gives a bit more context to that policy, will then examine some reflection questions to kind of think about before the seminar this week. And then in the seminar we're going to discuss more about this policy and the different levels at which it operates. When it comes to advertising. Indigenous language is part of our identity. But in classrooms in the Northern Territory, the tune is different. Last year, national tests found four out of five children in our remote schools didn't meet basic standards for English literacy. The territory Government blamed bilingual education. We absolutely want a young indigenous people to become proficient in the use of English language. The Acting Principal, John Lane, is new this year. His previous job was on a project for children with impaired hearing. It's turned out to be useful. It could sigh as as a ballpark figure that I need to N80 percent of the students at the school would have a hearing impairment. Middle, middle ear infections or perforated eardrums at some time in this goal, Korea, not only that, but every child, not you Manu, is learning English as a second language. And the school doesn't have a single qualified English as a second language teacher. To be able to adjust to a second language and start using a second language when you've got a hearing impairment as well, is extremely difficult. Recent literacy tests painted a depressing picture of larger Manu. Out of the three classes tested years 357, only one child in year 3 passed the test for English literacy. But larger money wasn't alone. National tests showed nearly all territory schools were well behind the rest of the country in literacy and numeracy. And remote bilingual schools were among the worst. A few weeks after the results, the territory's then Minister for Education dumped the head of a department and called a press conference or mandate that English will be the language of instruction in all Northern Territory schools for at least the first 48 hours of a school day. Linguists and educators were horrified. When I was really shocked. I was shocked because there was no consultation with communities. Are shocked because it went against common sense and it went against the community wishes. But you say fourth one, where is it? That policy only really affected the bilingual schools? Because the other schools by enlarge, already had the first for Amazon English in any school day. And yet their results were still terrible. I think it was ill-advised. It it blames language programs. When it's clear that when you're talking about excess disadvantaged students is how complex factors, health, attendance, housing, student motivation, the availability of jobs and the communities, and so on. Brian Devlin went to see that they administer Marion sporangia. She said, Look, I factor. And I think what she's referring to is that there was a like a consultation beforehand and the application of her for English directive of October 14th had many unintended consequences. It it certainly put a rough side with traditionally oriented indigenous people out in the communities. Hadn't gone very far down the line when he came to a little girl dance. But the Northern territory was under Prussia. The federal government wants to have the gap in indigenous literacy by 2020. It set a target and it wants to measure progress. What you've signed up to as a government with all of the other states. Explicit requirements in terms of kids getting some benchmark and national testing. That means even children from former bilingual schools whose first language isn't English, will have to do better as early as grade 3. We're dealing with children who are second language speakers of English, and therefore cannot be expected at year three, year five to have reached the same levels as first language speakers of English just takes much longer to learn a language, learn a second language. Is it fair to expect that children who are trying to learn a second language should meet the same benchmarks at the same time as children in other parts of the country who were learning in their first language. Absolutely. Bilingual education was the brainchild of the Whitlam government, which announced the policy in 1972, only two days after it was elected. Guatemala Thermopylae. Back in the seventies, bilingual education seemed full of promise. You and enter a PHD once. Once a child can lend her a design language and can write it properly and can speak English. Then what I'll try and take the child's rating niche as well. One of the first bilingual programs with Sit up the wall pre Paypal, that a community a few hours drive from Alice Springs, you into move. Commodity goes voice. Everyone, right? Jen Marlowe. Marlowe. With what? We would do build with what ended up on what I've gotten them all around. Can you say there are lots of trays, not subtrees. And this is V. Can you say B? And what noise does a B make? In 1974, a young windy body was used to mu's first bilingual coordinator. Then she taught English as a second language. I think the bilingual program will make it a lot better because when they come to scroll down, we'll start off learning in a language that they can understand. And while they are learning, they can learn English in school as a second language. Yes, that again, be it Probably antiemetic unesco into a nice smile when you say B, the liver. When the bada would stay teaching in the mood for the next 30 years. She still lives there and she's still believes in bilingual education. But she says It's exist as waxed and waned. You need to have the right kind of principle. Someone who does value, well bring language and culture and who has some understanding of bilingual learning and they're supportive of the Aboriginal stuff. Yeah. I remember that Glenda and bigger they grow up in a bush. Whether Turner, my density. Now, you really like, yeah, January PATRIC jungle law is one of the larger monies, very last traditional elders. He was a young man in the late 1940s when he saw white men for the first time. They put him in a truck and took him from the ten of my decision to what's now called lodge ammonia, that they're wet. They wonder to take him my own library, people who did you or why Briefing Program Data, my desert all gone. Nitrogen. Now I'm done. I love someone who genuinely jungle is language. Wolpert is one of only about 20 Aboriginal languages that is still being spoken by children. What number could soon be shrinking. Under the Northern territory's new policy of four hours English a day is only one hour lift in the afternoon for indigenous culture and language. Only one hour. And that Gwen, none. Not brag. What do you think will happen to the world? Keep. Okay, So we will have opportunity to discuss that particular case study law in our seminars this week. And what we wanted you to think about was the impact of global measures, of measuring which received national policies that are in place and national assessments. And the way that more local policies, such as the first four hours policies are implemented. And when you think about this, the questions we'd like to ask yourself Is the questions that we'd like you to ask yourself. Why was the first four hours policy introduced? What data was drawn on this decision-making process? Think about what the responses were from various stakeholders. So think about the indigenous community members. Think about linguists and teachers and members of Parliament and the different responses that they had to this policy. And what do you think might be the implications of such a policy once enacted? So thinking again about what we discussed in Week 1 around identity and the role of language in which you see in shaping identity. What would be the implications of that level of this policy? And so here's where we want you to also consider when there are policies put in place, Where are the possibilities for teachers and education workers to impact upon policy and to find that room for maneuver in how you enact policy, how you conduct your own practice, making him classroom spaces. Now acknowledging that not everyone in the subject is a teacher, or we'll be aspiring to work as a teacher. You might think about the different roles that you have as a member of an education institution, but as a student currently within the university for embroider education-related roles that you might perform in the future. What possibilities are there for members of education institutions to enact their own agency, to find room for maneuver and opportunities to influence policy. And now we'll just hear from Joe one more time to hear some of his ideas on the ways that teachers can innovate and can impact upon the ways that education institutions operate in their own practice. Innovation is a concept that's closely connected to policy, but it's not exactly the same thing. Innovation involves change. And there are two kinds of change on this slide, first-order change and second-order change, which improves how a system works or transforms the system completely. And here we see a policy power for teachers that is often neglected. A policy that is formally adopted by government could be a set of rules that tell teachers or schools how to act in relation to a certain problem. But imagine a teacher or group of teachers come up with a way to teach that radically changes how things work. That also becomes a kind of policy of bottom-up policy. But normally we call it innovation. And this innovation can come from commercial companies. It can come from teachers. And it can be of these two kinds. It can be a first-order change where you more or less do the same things as before, but you do them more efficiently. In other words, if you learn how to deliver a program more effectively, say, online, rather than in some other format. That's a temporary change. The content remains more or less the same. If you want to transform the system, you need to get people to think about what they're doing in a really different kind of way. Both of these first-order change and second-order change, our innovations and innovations can become policy as well as a formal government policy. So when we think about the role of teachers in local literacies and global literacy contexts, we need to think of teaching as a form of practice that can also influence policy through innovation. All right, So continuing to think about going into our ratings and seminars this week. So you've got two main readings for this week. The first is that free-body reading we've referred to a lot throughout this lecture that will provide you with an overview of various policy approaches in literacy. It also gives a bit of a socio-cultural view of the way that literacy is same within societies and the ways that policies reflect those different views of literacy. And the lobby anchor rating from 2000 now that is referring to a particular policy approach that's not as relevant today, 21 years later. But it gives an example of the kinds of stories that policy tells, particularly relating to languages in Australia. And some of the different discourses around this one literacy idea that informs back first four hours policy and how that has played a role in the history of languages and literacy in Australia. Now, in addition to the illustration that you did earlier today, the little artifacts that you created of seeing yourself in relationship to policy. Bring that along to your seminar. But also bring along a policy that is relevant to either the setting in which you're currently work as an educator or member of an education setting or a policy that's relevant to your own schooling. So it can be from schooling more generally, if you can't locate something specific to literacy, there are those examples at the beginning of this week, slides, if you would like to have a look at those examples, and maybe that will trigger some memory of another policy that you might like to bring and discussed in your seminar. So be prepared to bring those examples of policy along to share those particular documents for mandates in breakout spaces. And we'll have some discussion in those seminars around the different levels at which these policies are created.
